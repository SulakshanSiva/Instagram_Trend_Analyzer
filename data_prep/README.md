instaApiData.py

The idea that this file was built off of was to scrape individual profiles of POPULAR instagram users. So realistically
these users would have a lot of engagement on their posts = trendy posts/topics. We would have to find a varity of users from various fields such as Sports, Cinema, Makeup, Comedy, etc. For the time being I just 3 profiles from 3 different fields, and I scraped the top 20 latest posts on each of their pages.

The fields column was HARDCODED BY ME.

PROBLEMS: 
- Having a hard time finding popular users that actually have hashtags on their posts
- I have no clue how to get the location from which a post was posted
